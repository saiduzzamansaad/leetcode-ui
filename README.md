## 🧩 Sample Problem Template

Each problem folder includes:

- ✅ `solution.js` – Clean and optimized JS solution
- 📝 `explanation.md` – Step-by-step breakdown with visuals (when needed)
- 🧪 `test.js` – Node.js test cases with edge cases covered
- 📘 `README.md` – Quick summary, LeetCode link, difficulty level

---

## ✨ UI-Based Problem Visualizers

Some problems are brought to life visually using `React` & `Tailwind CSS`:

- 🔢 [Sorting Algorithms Visualizer](./public-ui/visual-sort)
- 📍 [Pathfinding in Grids](./public-ui/pathfinding)
- 🌐 [Graph Traversal UI](./public-ui/graph-traversal)

> These are perfect for interview prep, demos, or your developer portfolio.
